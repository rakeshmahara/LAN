=>In a Local Area Network (LAN), the Class C IP address is commonly used to assign unique addresses to devices. To implement Class C IP addressing in a LAN, the following steps can be taken:
Determine the network requirements: Before assigning IP addresses, it is important to determine the number of devices that will be connected to the network, the range of IP addresses required, and the subnet mask that will be used.
Choose a private IP address range: Class C addresses are used for networks that have up to 254 devices. For a LAN, a private IP address range can be used, such as 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255. This range is reserved for private networks and is not routable on the internet.
Assign IP addresses to devices: Once the IP address range has been determined, each device on the network can be assigned a unique IP address within that range. For example, a printer can be assigned the IP address 192.168.0.10, while a laptop can be assigned 192.168.0.20.
Configure the subnet mask: The subnet mask is used to divide the IP address range into smaller subnets. For a Class C network, the default subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, which means that the first three octets of the IP address are used for the network, and the last octet is used for the device.
Configure the router: The router is used to connect the LAN to the internet. The router needs to be configured with an IP address that is on the same network as the LAN, and it needs to be configured to route traffic between the LAN and the internet.
By following these steps, a LAN can be configured to use Class C IP addressing.
